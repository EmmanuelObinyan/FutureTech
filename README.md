## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version 18 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- A free [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) account (any Google account works)

### Step 1 — Fork the Repository

Go to the project on GitHub and click the **Fork** button at the top right. This creates your own copy of the project.

### Step 2 — Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
```

### Step 3 — Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This installs everything the project needs including React, Firebase, Tailwind CSS, and all other libraries.

### Step 4 — Create Your Own Firebase Project

> **Important:** Each contributor runs the app using their own free Firebase project. The project owner's Firebase account is private and not shared. This takes about 3 minutes and is completely free.

1. Go to [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com) and sign in with any Google account
2. Click **Go to console** → **Add project**
3. Give your project any name and follow the setup steps
4. Once inside your project, enable these two services:
   - **Firestore Database** → click Build → Firestore Database → Create database → start in test mode
   - **Authentication** → click Build → Authentication → Get started → enable Email/Password
5. Go to **Project settings** (gear icon at the top left) → scroll down to **Your apps**
6. Click the web icon `</>` to register a web app → give it any name → click **Register app**
7. You will see a config object like this — copy these values:

```js
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "...",
  authDomain: "...",
  projectId: "...",
  storageBucket: "...",
  messagingSenderId: "...",
  appId: "..."
};
```

### Step 5 — Set Up Your Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the `.env` file and paste in the values you copied from Firebase:

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=paste_your_apiKey_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=paste_your_authDomain_here
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=paste_your_projectId_here
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=paste_your_storageBucket_here
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=paste_your_messagingSenderId_here
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=paste_your_appId_here
```

> Your `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore` — it will never be pushed to GitHub. Never share or commit your real Firebase credentials.

### Step 6 — Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome. Here are the ways you can help:

### Completing Pages With Good UI Design

Some pages are still in progress. Pick an unfinished page, build it out with clean, responsive Tailwind CSS design, and submit a pull request.

### Fixing Component Structure

If you spot a component that is hard to read, poorly organised, or duplicated — refactor it. Keep components small, focused, and reusable.

### Improving Performance

Look for unnecessary re-renders, heavy imports, or slow operations. Optimise and submit a PR with a brief explanation of what you changed and why.

### Improving Documentation

Spotted something unclear in the README or code? Fix it. Good documentation makes the project easier for everyone.

   git add .
   git commit -m "Add ProtectedRoute wrapper (closes #4)"
   git push origin fix/protected-routes

5. Open a Pull Request on GitHub:
   - Base: main ← Compare: your branch
   - In the PR description, write "Closes #4" so the issue auto-closes on merge
